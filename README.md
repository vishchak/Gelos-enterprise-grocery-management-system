# Grocery Management System Project

## Introduction

Gelos enterprise is building an application for its upcoming grocery management system project. The application aims to store the details of the products and orders within the system. These details will be analyzed accordingly to increase the efficiency of keeping the products according to the business and market requirements.

## Problem Statement

Gelos enterprise needs you to develop two well-formed XML documents related to product and order details provided as "dataset" as Cl_BackendAPI_AE_Pro_2of3_Appx-2_Dataset which will be used by the application to easily fetch data and display to user and administration team at Gelos.

## Project Files

The project contains the following files:

- `productDetails.xml`: This XML document holds the product details such as Product Code, Product Name, Quantity, and Price.

- `productDetails.dtd`: The Document Type Definition (DTD) file that defines the structure and rules for `productDetails.xml` document.

- `orderDetails.xml`: This XML document stores the order details, including Order Number, Customer Number, Order Date, Products, and Total Amount.

- `orderDetails.dtd`: The Document Type Definition (DTD) file that defines the structure and rules for `productDetails.xml` document.


## Dataset Source

The dataset source file, Cl_BackendAPI_AE_Pro_2of3_Appx-2_Dataset, is  included in this repository.

## Usage

To access the data or modify it for the grocery management system application, the following steps can be followed:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Modify or analyze the XML data as needed for the application.

## Requirements

The project has been developed using XML and DTD. To work with the files, you will need a text editor or XML editor with DTD validation support.

Please feel free to contribute to the project or report any issues you encounter.
